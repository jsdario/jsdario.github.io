I decided to –finally– open a site about myself. I never really consider doing
it. Partly because I thought it was best to let facts and projects speak by
themselves. However, as time passed by, I find it increasingly important to
remind yourself about the things you have accomplish. With two objectives: (1) to
serve as motivation to keep working in the things you love and (2) so those
projects are not forgotten, or are better taken care of.

I chose to open a static site (using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)) because the following reasons:
* I am already familiar with the technology
* I find Markdown the best format to write posts in a minimal way
* Minimalism makes thing preserve in time, removing part of the fatigue of
seeing the same things over and over
* A static site can be delivered in a very fast fashion by a number of free services
* It's flexible enough to allow me play with low-level browser APIs and brind smalls samples of my past work to interactive pieces in this very site

This last point is specially important since a heavy part of the things I want
to showcase are not finite things but living projects; My coding activity; The
latest version to a certain app; A visualization of a certain state. All those
are things that _change_ through time, and I need access to _code_ to better
portray those realities in a single article. That is impossible for me to do
in most platforms (Tumblr, Medium & alike) and so the only way to achieve it
is to fork my own system.

I have no interest in update this site super frequently, but rather when there
is something that I want to share worth showcasing. I am a very eclectic person,
so rather than publishing blog entries, I'll keep [Medium](https://medium.com/@jsdario)
as the platform where I write and develop ideas, and keep entries here simple
enough to understand what has been done.
