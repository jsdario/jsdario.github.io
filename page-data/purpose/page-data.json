I never really consider doing\nit. Partly because I thought it was best to let facts and projects speak by\nthemselves. However, as time passed by, I find it increasingly important to\nremind yourself about the things you have accomplish. With two objectives: (1) to\nserve as motivation to keep working in the things you love and (2) so those\nprojects are not forgotten, or are better taken care of.</p>\n<p>I chose to open a static site (using <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a>) because the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I am already familiar with the technology</li>\n<li>I find Markdown the best format to write posts in a minimal way</li>\n<li>Minimalism makes thing preserve in time, removing part of the fatigue of\nseeing the same things over and over</li>\n<li>A static site can be delivered in a very fast fashion by a number of free services</li>\n<li>It’s flexible enough to allow me play with low-level browser APIs and brind smalls samples of my past work to interactive pieces in this very site</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This last point is specially important since a heavy part of the things I want\nto showcase are not finite things but living projects; My coding activity; The\nlatest version to a certain app; A visualization of a certain state. All those\nare things that <em>change</em> through time, and I need access to <em>code</em> to better\nportray those realities in a single article. That is impossible for me to do\nin most platforms (Tumblr, Medium &#x26; alike) and so the only way to achieve it\nis to fork my own system.</p>\n<p>I have no interest in update this site super frequently, but rather when there\nis something that I want to share worth showcasing. I am a very eclectic person,\nso rather than publishing blog entries, I’ll keep <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jsdario\">Medium</a>\nas the platform where I write and develop ideas, and keep entries here simple\nenough to understand what has been done.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Purpose","date":"February 16, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/purpose/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-language/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lengua Materna"}}}}}
