In Medium I have followers mainly
for the Engineering+Product content that I write in English or my essays and articles in Spanish. That way is very difficult to mantain a consistent publication strategy (and I don’t intend to), here I will have probably have less
restrictions so I will be able to keep pieces in whatever language I am more
comfortable writing for that topic. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jsdariorivera&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; I suffer the same dicotomy. Having this site will –all likely– allow me to definitely switch between both languages to only one in a hypothetical future where that decision matters at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny enough, in English my words spread faster and further, but in Spanish my
words resonate deeper within the smaller network. This is all likely a “problem”
shared by many authors and entrepreneurs in the digital era. I have no intention
to choose, but if there is a preferred strategy, I’d probably choose deeper than
wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words above about this site and its purpose are more for my future self
than for you; In any case, hope you find it interesting. I will use this way
my public voice to order my own thoughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Scope 🔬]]></title><link>https://jsdario.github.io//scope/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jsdario.github.io//scope/</guid><content:encoded></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Beginnings]]></title><description><![CDATA[Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and

Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This however showed weasel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well uncritical so misled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is very interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodness much until that fluid owl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the &lt;strong&gt;Italic Mountains&lt;/strong&gt;, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown &lt;em&gt;Bookmarksgrove&lt;/em&gt;, the headline of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Alphabet Village&lt;/a&gt; and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Longe and Parole&lt;/a&gt; and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So baboon this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung&lt;/li&gt;

impassive fruitlessly shut&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word “and” and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
return to its own, safe country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that “despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich.”?
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg&quot;&gt;Wikipedia Link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I didn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Purpose]]></title><description><![CDATA[I decided to –finally– open a site about myself. I never really consider doing

I never really consider doing
it. Partly because I thought it was best to let facts and projects speak by
themselves. However, as time passed by, I find it increasingly important to
remind yourself about the things you have accomplish. With two objectives: (1) to
serve as motivation to keep working in the things you love and (2) so those
projects are not forgotten, or are better taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to open a static site (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;) because the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am already familiar with the technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find Markdown the best format to write posts in a minimal way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimalism makes thing preserve in time, removing part of the fatigue of
seeing the same things over and over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A static site can be delivered in a very fast fashion by a number of free services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s flexible enough to allow me play with low-level browser APIs and brind smalls samples of my past work to interactive pieces in this very site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point is specially important since a heavy part of the things I want
to showcase are not finite things but living projects; My coding activity; The
latest version to a certain app; A visualization of a certain state. All those
are things that &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; through time, and I need access to &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt; to better
portray those realities in a single article. That is impossible for me to do
in most platforms (Tumblr, Medium &amp;#x26; alike) and so the only way to achieve it
is to fork my own system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no interest in update this site super frequently, but rather when there
is something that I want to share worth showcasing. I am a very eclectic person,
so rather than publishing blog entries, I’ll keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jsdario&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;
as the platform where I write and develop ideas, and keep entries here simple
enough to understand what has been done.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
