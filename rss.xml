each developer in the start-up. Later, it has been taken over by a group of passionate
friends to make a company of it with the mission of ‚ÄúMeasure Creative Work‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

In Medium I have followers mainly
for the Engineering+Product content that I write in English or my essays and articles in Spanish. That way is very difficult to mantain a consistent publication strategy (and I don‚Äôt intend to), here I will have probably have less
restrictions so I will be able to keep pieces in whatever language I am more
comfortable writing for that topic. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jsdariorivera&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; I suffer the same dicotomy. Having this site will ‚Äìall likely‚Äì allow me to definitely switch between both languages to only one in a hypothetical future where that decision matters at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny enough, in English my words spread faster and further, but in Spanish my
words resonate deeper within the smaller network. This is all likely a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù
shared by many authors and entrepreneurs in the digital era. I have no intention
to choose, but if there is a preferred strategy, I‚Äôd probably choose deeper than
wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words above about this site and its purpose are more for my future self
than for you; In any case, hope you find it interesting. I will use this way
my public voice to order my own thoughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Purpose]]></title><description><![CDATA[I decided to ‚Äìfinally‚Äì open a site about myself. I never really consider doing

I never really consider doing
it. Partly because I thought it was best to let facts and projects speak by
themselves. However, as time passed by, I find it increasingly important to
remind yourself about the things you have accomplish. With two objectives: (1) to
serve as motivation to keep working in the things you love and (2) so those
projects are not forgotten, or are better taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to open a static site (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;) because the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am already familiar with the technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find Markdown the best format to write posts in a minimal way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimalism makes thing preserve in time, removing part of the fatigue of
seeing the same things over and over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A static site can be delivered in a very fast fashion by a number of free services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs flexible enough to allow me play with low-level browser APIs and brind smalls samples of my past work to interactive pieces in this very site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point is specially important since a heavy part of the things I want
to showcase are not finite things but living projects; My coding activity; The
latest version to a certain app; A visualization of a certain state. All those
are things that &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; through time, and I need access to &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt; to better
portray those realities in a single article. That is impossible for me to do
in most platforms (Tumblr, Medium &amp;#x26; alike) and so the only way to achieve it
is to fork my own system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no interest in update this site super frequently, but rather when there
is something that I want to share worth showcasing. I am a very eclectic person,
so rather than publishing blog entries, I‚Äôll keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jsdario&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;
as the platform where I write and develop ideas, and keep entries here simple
enough to understand what has been done.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
