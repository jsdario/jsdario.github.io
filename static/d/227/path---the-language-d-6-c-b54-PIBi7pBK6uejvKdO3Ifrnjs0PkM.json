In Medium I have followers mainly\nfor the Engineering+Product content that I write in English or my essays and articles in Spanish. That way is very difficult to mantain a consistent publication strategy (and I don‚Äôt intend to), here I will have probably have less\nrestrictions so I will be able to keep pieces in whatever language I am more\ncomfortable writing for that topic. In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsdariorivera\">Twitter</a> I suffer the same dicotomy. Having this site will ‚Äìall likely‚Äì allow me to definitely switch between both languages to only one in a hypothetical future where that decision matters at all.</p>\n<p>Funny enough, in English my words spread faster and further, but in Spanish my\nwords resonate deeper within the smaller network. This is all likely a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù\nshared by many authors and entrepreneurs in the digital era. I have no intention\nto choose, but if there is a preferred strategy, I‚Äôd probably choose deeper than\nwider.</p>\n<p>These words above about this site and its purpose are more for my future self\nthan for you; In any case, hope you find it interesting. I will use this way\nmy public voice to order my own thoughs.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/the-language/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hi-folks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/scope/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Scope üî¨"}}}}
